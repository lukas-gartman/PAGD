### Smartphone-based Solution to Distributed Gunshot Detection and Localization using Deep Learning

A Bachelor's thesis by *Martin Engstr√∂m, Lukas Gartman, Salam Hani, Sven Kellgren, Anas Masri*, and *Tobias Olsson*.

**Chalmers University** and **University of Gothenburg** at the **Computer Science and Engineering Department (CSE)**.

### Introduction
This Bachelor thesis explored the feasibility of developing a smartphone-based gunshot detection system that prioritises user privacy. The system leverages deep learning techniques to accurately identify gunshot audio events in real-time. By utilising GPS technology, the system can potentially pinpoint the location of the incident and alert relevant authorities.

### Technical Approach

The thesis delves into the technical aspects of such a system, including:

1. **Audio Feature Extraction**:
    Exploring techniques to extract relevant audio features from smartphone microphone input.
2. **Deep Learning Model**:
    Investigating the suitability of deep neural networks for gunshot sound classification.
3. **Real-time Inference**:
    Discussing the challenges and potential solutions for real-time processing on mobile devices.
4. **GPS Integration**:
    Considering the privacy implications and technical considerations of GPS usage.
5. **Privacy-Preserving Data Transmission**:
    Proposing strategies to minimise data exposure and ensure user privacy.

### Challenges and Future Directions

The thesis highlights the significant challenges associated with developing a robust and privacy-preserving gunshot detection system, including:

* **Acoustic Variability**:
    The need to address variations in acoustic environments.
* **Computational Constraints**:
    The limitations of mobile devices in terms of processing power and battery life.
* **Privacy Concerns**:
Balancing the need for accurate detection with user privacy.

Future research and development efforts could focus on addressing these challenges and further enhancing the system's capabilities.
