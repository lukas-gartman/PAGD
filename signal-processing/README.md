## Requirements
numpy, matplotlib, and tensorflow are required.
```
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow
```
## How to use
Great care is needed to keep all of the training data in the same dimensions. Use **.shape** to see if this is true. A subfolder called **data** is needed to exist next to **main.py**, containing all of the .wav files you intend to convert to spectrograms.
