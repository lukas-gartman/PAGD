# Define the model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(32, 3, activation='relu', input_shape=(timesteps, input_dim)),
    # The first argument in tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(32, ...) is the number of filters or output channels in the convolutional layer.
    # In a convolutional neural network, filters are applied to the input to extract features from the data. The number of filters 
    # determines the depth of the output of the layer and effectively controls the complexity of the model. A larger number of 
    # filters allows the model to learn more complex features, but also increases the risk of overfitting. The second argument in 
    # tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(32, 3, ...) is the size of the convolutional kernel or filter.
    # A convolutional kernel is a small matrix that is used to apply convolution operations on the input data. The size of the kernel 
    # determines the spatial extent of the features that can be extracted by the layer. In this example, 3 is used as the size of the 
    # kernel, meaning that the filter is a 3-point sliding window that is moved across the input signal to compute the output.
    # The choice of kernel size can have a significant impact on the performance of the model, and different values may work better for 
    # different problems. In general, smaller kernels are better for detecting fine-grained features, while larger kernels are better for 
    # detecting coarser features. You may need to experiment with different values for this parameter to determine the best value for your 
    # specific problem. The third argument in tf.keras.layers.Conv1D(32, 3, activation='relu', ...) is the activation function used in the layer.
    # The activation function is applied to the output of the layer to introduce non-linearity into the model. This non-linearity allows the model 
    # to learn complex relationships between the input and output.
    # In this example, the activation function used is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, which is defined as f(x) = max(0, x). 
    # ReLU is a popular choice for activation functions in neural networks and has been found to work well in many applications.
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling1D(2),
    # The MaxPooling1D layer in the example code has a window size of 2. This means that it will reduce the dimension of the output by half. 
    # Specifically, for every two adjacent elements in the output, the MaxPooling1D layer will select the maximum value and pass it forward to 
    # the next layer.
    # MaxPooling1D is used to extract the most important features and reduce the dimensionality of the output. This can help reduce the number 
    # of parameters in the model, which can prevent overfitting, and also speed up the training process.
    # In this specific model, the MaxPooling1D layer is placed after the Conv1D layer to extract the most important features from the convolutional
    # layer and reduce the dimensionality of the output. The output of the MaxPooling1D layer is then passed to the Flatten layer, which flattens the
    # output into a 1D vector, and then to a series of fully connected layers for further processing.
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    # The Flatten layer in a neural network is a simple layer that converts the output of the previous layer, which may be multidimensional, into a 
    # one-dimensional vector. This is necessary because the fully connected layers, which usually follow the Flatten layer, require a one-dimensional input.
    # In the example code, the output of the MaxPooling1D layer is a 3D tensor of shape (batch_size, downsampled_timesteps, number_of_filters), where 
    # batch_size is the number of samples in each batch, downsampled_timesteps is the number of time steps after down-sampling, and number_of_filters 
    # is the number of filters used in the convolutional layer.
    # The Flatten layer takes this 3D tensor and flattens it into a 1D tensor of shape (batch_size, downsampled_timesteps * number_of_filters), 
    # which can then be passed on to the fully connected layers.
    # In summary, the Flatten layer serves as a bridge between the convolutional layers, which extract features from the input data, and the 
    # fully connected layers, which perform the classification/regression task.
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    # the Dense layer has 64 neurons, meaning that it has a "width" of 64. The activation function used in the layer is the Rectified Linear Unit 
    # (ReLU) activation function, which is defined as f(x) = max(0, x). ReLU is a popular choice for activation functions in neural networks and 
    # has been found to work well in many applications.
    # The purpose of the Dense layer is to learn non-linear relationships between the features extracted by the previous layers and the output of 
    # the model. The output of the previous layer, which is a 1D vector, is fed into the Dense layer, and the weights of the layer are learned 
    # during training to transform the input into a new representation that is more suitable for the final task of the model.
    # In summary, the Dense layer in the example code is a fully connected layer with 64 neurons and ReLU activation function, which learns
    # non-linear relationships between the features extracted by the previous layers and the final output of the model.
    tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.5),
    # The Dropout layer in Keras randomly drops out, or deactivates, a certain percentage of neurons in the previous layer during training. In 
    # the example code, the Dropout layer is defined with a rate of 0.5, which means that 50% of the neurons in the previous layer will be randomly 
    # deactivated during each training epoch.
    # By randomly deactivating neurons, the model is forced to learn more robust and generalizable features that are not dependent on specific neurons. 
    # This can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.
    # During inference, when the model is used to make predictions on new data, all neurons are activated and the full model is used. Dropout is only 
    # applied during training to help the model learn better and more generalizable features.
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
    # The Dense layer in Keras is a fully connected layer, which means that every neuron in the previous layer is connected to every neuron in the current layer. The Dense layer is typically used as the last layer in a classification model to produce the final output.

    # In the example code, the Dense layer is defined with a single neuron and a sigmoid activation function. The sigmoid function produces an output 
    # in the range of 0 to 1, which can be interpreted as a probability score.
    # For a binary classification problem like gunshot detection, where the model is trying to predict whether a sound event is a gunshot or not, 
    # a single output neuron with a sigmoid activation function is appropriate. The output of the sigmoid function can be interpreted as the 
    # probability that the input sound event is a gunshot. If the probability is above a certain threshold (e.g. 0.5), the model predicts that the 
    # input event is a gunshot, and if it is below the threshold, the model predicts that it is not a gunshot.
    # In summary, the Dense layer with a single neuron and sigmoid activation function in the example code is used to produce a probability score 
    # for the binary classification problem of gunshot detection.

# The number of TensorFlow Keras layers recommended for detecting gunshots in a model would 
# depend on various factors, such as the type of data being used, the complexity of the model, 
# and the desired accuracy. There is no specific number of layers that can be considered as a 
# standard or best practice for this specific use case.

# However, it is generally recommended to start with a smaller number of layers and increase the 
# complexity of the model gradually, while monitoring its performance. This approach allows for 
# identifying the optimal number of layers required to achieve the desired accuracy and prevent 
# overfitting or underfitting of the model.

# In addition to the number of layers, other factors such as the choice of activation functions, 
# the use of regularization techniques, and the selection of hyperparameters also play a significant 
# role in the performance of the model. Therefore, it is important to approach the development of a 
# model for gunshot detection with careful experimentation and evaluation to determine the best architecture and 
# hyperparameters for the specific use case.

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
# The compile method in Keras is used to configure the learning process for a model. It takes three main arguments:

# optimizer: the algorithm used to update the model parameters during training. The most commonly used optimizer 
# is Adam, which is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that can handle sparse gradients on noisy problems.
# loss: the loss function used to evaluate the performance of the model. For binary classification problems like gunshot 
# detection, the most commonly used loss function is binary crossentropy, which measures the difference between the predicted probabilities 
# and the actual labels.
# metrics: a list of metrics used to monitor the performance of the model during training and testing. In this case, the model will be 
# evaluated using accuracy, which is the proportion of correct predictions made by the model.
# In summary, the compile method in the example code sets up the binary classification model for training using the Adam optimizer, binary 
# crossentropy as the loss function, and accuracy as the evaluation metric.



# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_val, y_val))
# For y_train, it's all sounds that are not gunshot sounds. In order for the module to be trained, it needs to be able to distinguish between
# what sounds are gunshot sounds and what sounds are not gunshot sounds respectively. Meanwhile, x_train is the dataset containing all the 
# gunshot sounds we've collected. We could use ESC-50 and UrbanSound8K datasets in order to train it.

# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print('Test Accuracy: ', test_acc)
